## üìå Overview

This project involves fine-tuning open-source large language models with chemical science data, evaluated using a specialized automated scoring system. The resulting chemical intelligent assistant system not only leverages the fine-tuned large models but also allows for flexible integration of various advanced models. It integrates chemistry-specific features like molecular visualization and literature retrieval, while also possessing limited improvement capabilities through knowledge accumulation, skill acquisition, and collaborative mechanisms. This approach helps enhance the system's professional abilities and interaction quality, partially addressing certain limitations of traditional static AI systems in the chemistry domain.

## üöÄ Leveraging Free GPU Resources on Colab
üåü Building on this, all the project's fine-tuned models can leverage the free GPU resources available on Colab and utilize internal network penetration technology to make calls. This is perfect for teams without funding to use this project, as it will continue to improve and optimize over time. üöÄ

In this demonstration video, you will learn:
- How to set up the environment in Google Colab
- Step-by-step process of loading and running our fine-tuned models
- Tips for optimizing GPU resource usage
- Techniques for maintaining stable model performance
- Common troubleshooting solutions
